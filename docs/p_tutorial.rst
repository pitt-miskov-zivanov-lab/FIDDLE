### This interactive jupyter notebook walks you though all of the pertinent code and functions to:

1. Create a new Erdos-Renyi or Barabasi-Alberts Network.
2. Remove edges from these networks in a consistent and systematic way.
3. Extend a network with missing edges using the Breadth First Addition method (BFA).
4. Extend a network with missing edges using the Depth First Addition method (BFA).
